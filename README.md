# Nimbus Note (Frontend)

This repository is the frontend of Nimbus Note, a project tracking app that allows you to view, add, edit and filter projects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Main features

### Register new project

Users can register a new project and add important information, such as title, category, deadline, username, priority, and description.

### Project list

Users can see the project list with all the projects they've registered sorted by deadline. Here they can also see the details of their projects by clicking on each accordion header.

Users will be alerted when a project is overdue (deadline has passed and status is not "Complete").

### Filtering projects

Users can filter the project list on a search input (which will filter on title) and based on status.

### Edit project

Users can edit the details of each project, by clicking "Edit project".

### Delete projects

Users can delete entries in the project list page.
